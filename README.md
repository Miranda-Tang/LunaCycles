## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project lies in the commendable work initiated by the youCode @ UBC community. Aimed at promoting wellness among underrepresented groups, we felt an urge to contribute with a solution that addresses the unique needs of women. The result was the design of a menstrual tracking app that places women's well-being at its core.

## Features

### 🪄 Personalization and Prediction

Understanding that every woman's cycle is unique, our app learns from user inputs to provide personalized insights. This feature makes our app an invaluable tool for planning and health monitoring.

### 📖 Empowerment Through Knowledge

We believe in empowerment through knowledge. By providing insights into their menstrual cycles, we help users gain a deeper understanding of their own bodies.

### 👀 Convenience and Accessibility

Harnessing the power of design, we use warm and comforting colors and imagery to create a welcoming atmosphere. This approach aims to reduce anxiety associated with menstrual health management. Moreover, we have simplified the process of logging with intuitive calendar functions for ease of use.

### 👯‍♀️ Community and Support

To provide a comprehensive solution, we integrated Arc’teryx into our website. This feature enables users to interact with exercise recommendations and receive suggestions for appropriate outdoor outfits.

## Technological Stack

The journey began with sketching out the demo on Figma, which paved the way for actual development. We used the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** stack to build this web application. The front end was developed with JavaScript, CSS, and React, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. On the other hand, the back end was built with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, ensuring secure data handling and smooth performance.

Join us in this initiative and let's transform menstrual health management together.
